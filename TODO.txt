Important Refactorings:

- Split HtmlHander into two files: one handles the nameinput and loading screen,
the other handles the game's HUD (number of clients connected, chat interaction).
The HUD handler then is a member of game class, which saves the workarounds in main.js:
register calls and updatePlayerAmount

- js files could be divided into groups:
view: HtmlHandler, HudHandler
controller: CharacterController, LocalCharacterController, RemoteCharacterController
model (changing): game: Game, Player
model (game specific logic): network: SocketHandler
model (loosely coubled logic): engine: LocalInputReader, CharacterAnimator
