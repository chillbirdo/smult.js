Technology used: Client: <b>Html5, JavaScript, CSS, Spritely</b>; Server: <b>NodeJS, socket.io</b>

As a little experiment I decided to make a realtime client-server application solely in JS, where I used the graphics of a game, that I was working on long ago: <a href="http://gilber.vs120026.hl-users.com/WEBSITES/Portfolio/techwork_smult.html" title="SMULT">SMULT</a>. The graphics has once been designed by <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/cherzog">Christian Herzog</a>, a former university colleague.
The project could be used as a good starting point if you want to create a HTML5 game with similar concept.
